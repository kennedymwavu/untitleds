The task takes about one hour to solve for a statistics expert.
R programming is in huge demand on our platform so we wish to work only with true statistics experts.
During the high season, we can offer a nearly full-time position paying 25-30 USD/hour. We don't really care where you are located, we just strictly require top-quality solutions.
Please complete the task as if it was a real order from our client - send the solution to support@homeworkhelponline.net and one of our statisticians will review it. Please don't use unnecessary R packages.

Thank you for your interest and we are looking forward to fulfilling collaboration.
